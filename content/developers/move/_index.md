Smart contracts are the embodiment of the public chain's expressive power and the key to ecological development. The current module introduces the smart contract language Move in depth from various perspectives to help you understand Move contract development in all aspects.

Move is a smart contract language of linear logic, a smart contract language specially built for financial scenarios, with good security.

Move has Ability features, abstracting four kinds of commonly used ability, respectively, copy, drop, key, store. according to the characteristics of different business scenarios themselves, different ability applied to different Struct, can design different characteristics, different security structure, such as Resource type. Move has unique advantages in both FT and NFT, and is a good security tool for DeFi scenarios.

In addition to resource-oriented programming, Move also has a very important feature, generalization-oriented programming. move is a purely statically typed smart contract language, which does not present various security risks caused by dynamic calls. To improve scalability, Move supports generics. Starcoin has taken advantage of generalization to design official standard protocols, such as the NFT protocol.

Move has a complete set of formal verification tools, which cannot be matched by other smart contracts such as Solidity, and Move's formal verification uses the written smart contract code as input data to prove the security of the contract code in a mathematical way to better protect the security of smart contracts.

More in-depth information about Move will be provided in the following areas, starting from the simple to the deep, step by step.
