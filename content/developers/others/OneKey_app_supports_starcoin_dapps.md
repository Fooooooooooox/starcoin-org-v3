title: OneKey App supports Starcoin Dapps
---

StarMask is the first Chrome extension wallet that supports the Starcoin blockchain.

We can find a list of [Dapps](https://starcoin.org/en/ecosystem/) that supports Starcoin, let's take [Starswap](https://starswap.xyz/) as an example.

First, we need to make sure that the StarMask extension is installed in the Chrome browser.

Secondly, user need to `Connect Wallet` on a Dapp first.

Then confirm any transaction in a pop-up window of the StarMask.

For the mobile phone users, the screen is too small, and the interaction between the Chrome extension pop-up window and the Dapp page is too inconvenient to use.

In order to solve this problem, We partnered with `OneKey` to support starcoin dapps, which provides Desktop/IOS/Android apps for both PC and mobile.

Next, we will demonstrate step by step how to use Starcoin's Dapps in the OneKey App.

First let's create an account.

The OneKey App supports three types of accounts:

1. App Wallet account
2. Account imported by mnemonic or private key
3. OneKey hardware wallet account

Let's import a StarMask account with it's private key.

Paste the private key:

Select the `STC` network, enter `Account Name`
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-14.png" class="img-phone">}}

The account is imported(created) successfully.

Next, we switch to the `Explore` menu in the OneKey App

{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-16.png" class="img-phone">}}

Enter the web address of Starswap: `https://starswap.xyz` in the `Search...` input box at the bottom of this page.

In the swap page, click `Connect Wallet`

Select `StarMask`
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-19.png" class="img-phone">}}

Click `Confirm`
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-20.png" class="img-phone">}}

Next, we swap some STC to STAR
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-21.png" class="img-phone">}}

select `STAR`
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-22.png" class="img-phone">}}

Enter `0.5` STC and click `Swap`
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-23.png" class="img-phone">}}

Click `Confirm Swap`
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-24.png" class="img-phone">}}

On the Transaction Confirmation page, click `Confirm`
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-25.png" class="img-phone">}}

Close this popup window
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-26.png" class="img-phone">}}

Switch to the `Account` menu and click the `History` tab
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-27.png" class="img-phone">}}

There is a `Pending` transaction in the history list
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-28.png" class="img-phone">}}

After waiting for a while, the transaction will be confirmed on the chain.
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-29.png" class="img-phone">}}

Now, you can click the transaction, and in the pop-up window of the transaction details, click the button behind `Hash`
{{< figure src="/images/onekey/onekey-30.png" class="img-phone">}}

It will open a new web page in the [stcscan](https://stcscan.io) browser, display the transaction details.

The above is the whole process of a transaction between OneKey App and Starswap.

The other Dapps' interactions are very similar.
